# 🕵️ OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) — Anonymized Case Study

Welcome to my **OSINT repository**! This space is dedicated to practicing and showcasing ethical, educational Open Source Intelligence techniques using publicly available tools and consent-based scenarios.

## 📄 What's Inside

Anonymized_OSINT_Report.pdf
A fully anonymized, real-world inspired OSINT case study that includes:
- Link tracking via a consented test
- Basic metadata and device info capture
- IP-based geolocation using open tools
- Ethical considerations and responsible reporting

⚠️ **No personal data or identifying information is shared.** This report is strictly for educational and demonstration purposes.
